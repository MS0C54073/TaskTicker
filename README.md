## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (version 18.x or later recommended)
- npm (which comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```
Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the Git repository and `<repository-directory>` with the name of the folder created.

### 2. Install dependencies

Next, navigate to the project's root directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will download and install all the packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### 3. Run the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` (or the URL shown in your terminal) to see the application in action.

The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts a production server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code for errors.

That's it! You now have the project running locally.
